				What is staking?
			</Text>
			<Text {...theme.SUPPORT_PARAGRAPH_STYLE.paragraphText()}>
				{" "}
				The word staking comes from the word stake. Stake means to support, or
				to secure something, such as a tent. In the blockchain space, staking
				means to deposit tokens to support the network by verifying transactions
				and sustaining its stability.
			</Text>
			<Text {...theme.SUPPORT_PARAGRAPH_STYLE.paragraphText()}>
				{" "}
				The background for the creation of staking in blockchain is related to
				how blocks are verified. Originally Proof of Work was to secure and
				verify the network, but it was inefficient as it wastes a large amount
				of electricity. Proof of Stake came about as an alternative to Proof of
				Work.
			</Text>
			<Text {...theme.SUPPORT_PARAGRAPH_STYLE.paragraphText()}>
				{" "}
				As a part of DeFi, staking has become a popular financial instrument,
				but in reality it was created for the security of blockchain networks
				and to incentivize those participating in the operation of the network.
				Participants stake tokens as deposits, and the network provides them
				with interest as a reward for offering this service. Staking with
				Tokamak Network is similar but different.
			</Text>
			<Text {...theme.SUPPORT_PARAGRAPH_STYLE.paragraphText()} mb={"90px"}>
				Typical Staking based blockchains have one chain with various operators
				and thus the trust of operators wasnâ€™t a significant factor. But for
				Tokamak Networks Layer 2 chains, anyone can open and run a plasma and
				roll-up chain. Because of this, the chain economy must be structured
				that anyone can trust the operator and the data of the L2 chain. The
				Tokamak Network staking system allows for the creation of this
				credibility.
